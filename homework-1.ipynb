    "\n",
    "Some tasks in this homework go slightly beyond what we covered in class. **You are encouraged to use any resources** to figure them out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ChatGPT / Claude** - Ask AI to explain concepts or help debug\n",
    "- **Google** - Search for tutorials and documentation\n",
    "- **Cursor AI** - Use `Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L` to ask questions in your editor\n",
    "- **Stack Overflow** - A great resource for programming questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** In real engineering, knowing how to find answers is just as important as knowing the answers. These tools are here to help you learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: When you use external resources, please cite them (e.g., \"I used ChatGPT to learn about...\" or \"I found this on...\"). This builds good habits!"
